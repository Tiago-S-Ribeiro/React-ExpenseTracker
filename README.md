<p text-align="justify">This simple application allows the addition of new expenses with a title, amount and date, and tracking of those expenses. They'll be rendered in the component below according to the year selected in the dropdown menu. Besides that, it also has a chart to show visually the amount spent in specific months compared to others based on that years highest expense.</p>
<br/>
To try this out, just download this repository, open your terminal inside the desired location and simply run:

<br/>

```
npm install
npm start
```
